SpeedTester is a tool which tests the speed of your internet connection periodically and writes the results into the file "results.txt" wich will look as follows:

19.02.2015 17:06:08 18,57 Mbit/s
19.02.2015 17:07:08 21,73 Mbit/s
19.02.2015 17:09:24 21,79 Mbit/s


If supported, SpeedTester will settle in the tray menu. I tried it with windows 7,8, openSuse and linux mint.
Otherwise the process will only run in background without the tray icon.

The repo is an intelliJ project.
