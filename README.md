SpeedTester is a tool which tests the speed of your internet connection periodically and writes the results with timestamps into the file "results.txt".


If supported, SpeedTester will settle in the tray menu. I tried it with windows 7,8, openSuse and linux mint.
Otherwise the process will only run in background without the tray icon.

The repo is an IntelliJ project.
